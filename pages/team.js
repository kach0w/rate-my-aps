                    Hello, I'm a rising junior at BASIS Independent Silicon Valley. My role in Rate My AP's is the primary web developer. I helped make the website as well as the web application. In this role I hope to help more students learn more about the AP's they intend to take so that they are more informed about information like difficulty or course content. In my free time, I enjoy watching old films and playing basketball.

                    Hi! I'm Prajwal Dacharla, a 15 year old incoming junior at Dublin High School. I serve as the UI Designer for this application and I am proud to put my creativity and designing skills to work. As this project is meant to aid highschoolers through their process of picking courses for the school year, it is essential our user interface is properly navigable and functional. When I'm not working, I enjoy boxing, playing video games, listening to music, and hanging out with my friends and family.

I hope to make the journey of AP courses simpler and more effective to combat the difficulty of AP courses. In my spare time I enjoy biking and learning new tidbits of information.
